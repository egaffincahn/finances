R package to track finances

I wrote a package in R to keep track of finances. Each transaction has a date, budget category, description, and an amount for each of the accounts associated with a centralized ledger. The most basic features are adding new transactions and performing visualizations of the ledger data in multiple ways.

Keeps a ledger with all your transactions in it. Has the capability to add new transactions to one or more financial accounts, track budgets, keep track of multiple accounts, and visualize your data in several ways.

To install, run on the R command line:
> devtools::install_github(repo = "egaffincahn/finances")

or download and install from the tarball in the repo.
